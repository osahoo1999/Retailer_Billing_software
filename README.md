# Retailer_Billing_software
Though it is an institution or an organization or it might be a shop, there should be 
some mechanism which can ensure efficient management of all the available data 
over a period time. Specially, when we look upon the grocery stores many times 
shopkeeper buys lots of goods from whole seller without any proper strategy. That 
goods are get stored as stocks. Sometimes it happens that the goods get wasted 
there because of proper planning of how much goods to buy and how much goods 
to store as stock. Again, many times, the shops use traditional method of billing 
which is done by writing the price of value in a piece of paper. There is a lot of 
chance that the paper can be lost/ damaged and may arise ambiguity when the 
customer wants to return the goods. In order to solve these problems, Retailer 
Billing Software is the one stop solution.  
But, at the Supplier end, many times problems happened like not storing the 
distributors details, not storing much stocks in the store room for deliver the good 
to the retailers in the given time. Again, when the retailer orders for particular 
groceries using traditional method, many times ambiguity of misplacement of order 
also happened. It can be solved if the retailer able to make the order request through 
some digital platform. Also, the stocks need to be visualized so that it will be easier 
for the Supplier to manage goods in better way. Hence, every supplier should have 
the own system for storing the details of available stocks which is visible to the 
registered retailers. And the retailers should also able to make order in the same 
platform as per requirement.
